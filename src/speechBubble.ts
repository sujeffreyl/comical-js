// This file contains the definition for how a speech bubble is made.
// It is roughly an oval, but actually made as a sequence of four bezier curves,
// which allows it to vary in shape. You can imagine (or see, in the "playing with beziers"
// test case) that there is a control point in the middle of each side of the rectangle,
// with handles in the direction of the corners. The handleFraction arguments control
// what fraction of the distance to the corner the handles are placed. 0.6, 0.8 seems
// to give a nice default. Larger values make the shape more like a rounded rectangle,
// smaller ones more like an ellipse (or even a diamond).
